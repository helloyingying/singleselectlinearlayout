# What is this?
It is a LinearLayout that only one child view can be selected. You can implement the callback yourself.

If you click the first one:

![](/image/select1.png)

And if you click the third:

![](/image/select3.png)

# How to use?

Very simple. 

1. Clone the library, and copy ** SingleSelectLinearLayout.java ** and ** ITMSearchInShopSingleSelectCallback.java ** into your project. 
2. Implement the interface ** ITMSearchInShopSingleSelectCallback **, and custorm the two method   ** onItemSelected(View view), onItemUnSelected(View view)**.
3. Use ** SingleSelectLinearLayout ** as LinearLayout in your XML or code.


# What's more?

You can set the default selected item index, just like:

    ((SingleSelectLinearLayout) findViewById(R.id.single_select_test)).setDefaultSelectedPosition(2).initChildClickListener(this);
